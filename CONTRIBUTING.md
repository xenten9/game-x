# Good pull requests and issues!
Any issues or pull requests are accepted although do keep in mind that the project is currently just a hobby and likely at times be a low priority of mine.
* tldr; there is no request not worth making.

# Conduct for contributed code
Generally speaking it is adivised the code be match to pep8 and match the look of the code around it, however minor deviations are okay so long as they dont make coding
harder for people later on down the line.
* tldr; pep8 + camoflage

# NOTE
I (Xenten) am not a professional and any advice on reformating organizational structures, or in best practices is greatly appreacited.
* tldr; project may not always get updates.
